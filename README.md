## Walmart Sales Prediction using Random Forest Algorithm

1. As we know Walmart is one of the largest company in terms of sales and employees. They are best in delivering groceries in overall USA online or in store.
2. They have sales data, which they want to analyse and predict the sales based on some features.
3. They want to evaluate, if there is any relation between the holiday and sales at their 45 stores. 
4. Also, Walmart wants to find the relation between the unemployment rate, Consumer Price Index and Weekly sales.
5. I have predicted the sales of Walmart which tells what will be the sale of that week if we provide them the temperature, unemployment rate and CPI.
