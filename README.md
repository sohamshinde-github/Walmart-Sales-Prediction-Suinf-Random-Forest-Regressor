## Walmart Sales Prediction using Random Forest Algorithm

1. As we know Walmart has the best in delivering groceries in overall USA.
2. They have sales data which they want to analyse and predict the weekly sales.
3. They want to find is there any relation between the holiday and sales at their 45 stores. 
4. Also, Walmart wants to find the relation between the unemployment rate, Consumer Price Index and Weekly sales.
5. I have predicted the sales of Walmart which tells what will be the sale of that week if we provide them the temperature, unemployment rate and CPI.
